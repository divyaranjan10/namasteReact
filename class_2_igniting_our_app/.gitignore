# anything which can be auto-generated can be put inisde the gitignore file
# anything which we can generate on our server can be put inside gitignore file
# for ex: when we write npm install, through which we can generate node modules
# also like in the case of dist folder, we can genearte it using parcel commands
# and 'parcel-cache' is automatically created by parcel for caching 

# parcel (bundler) generates cache files
.parcel-cache

# node artifact files
dist
node_modules
